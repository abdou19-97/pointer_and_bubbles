//Pointers and Bubbles

The goal: is to write a program that implement the swap algorithm with pointers

The input: Using pointers to navigate through the array swap from low 
           to the high number

The output: Sorting a list from an decreasing to an increasing number



The Step: 
     -start with the function prototypes.(printValues(), sort(), swap())
      without puting any values in them.
     
      - creating an array called values[]
    
      -define main function
        
         *Inside this main printing out the array
          with sorting each element to an ascending order
          
          *After that we print the printValues which gonna give 
           me a sorting array like [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
           
          *write return(0) command

       -end the main function

   
       -emplementing swap function passing 2 argument to it as pointers
           (int *i, int *j)
          
          #creating a variable
          #assigning that variable to the pointer *i
          #assigning *i to the pointer *j
          #assigning *j to the the first variable to complete the swap

        -end the swap the function

        -emplementing the sort function with no argument
         
          #assign 2 variable (int i, j)
          
          #using first for loop to ascending the element of the list
          
             #using the second for loop for comparing the values
               
                  #using if statment to compare the emlement of the array
               
                      # swaping the address of the values
                       
                      # printing the values
                   #end of if
              #end of the second for loop
            #end of the first for loop

          -end the sort function

         -emplementing printvalue function
            
             #using for loop to print out the value
              in every itration
          
         -end of printvalues function
